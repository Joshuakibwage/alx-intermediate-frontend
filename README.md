# ALX Intermediate Frontend Projects

Welcome to the **ALX Intermediate Frontend** repository â€” a collection of structured projects developed as part of the **ALX ProDev Frontend Program**. These projects aim to strengthen real-world frontend development skills by focusing on modern, semantic, and accessible web design practices.

## ðŸ“˜ semantic-html

The `semantic-html` folder focuses on two core areas of modern web development:

### âœ… Semantic HTML  
Utilizes meaningful HTML5 elements like:
- `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`
- `<nav>`, `<aside>`, `<figure>`, and `<figcaption>`

Semantic elements help define the structure and purpose of content, making it easier for browsers, developers, and assistive technologies (like screen readers) to understand the document hierarchy.

### â™¿ ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)  
ARIA attributes are applied to enhance accessibility â€” especially in dynamic content and custom UI components where semantic HTML alone isn't enough.

Examples include:
- `role="navigation"`, `role="button"`, `aria-label`, `aria-hidden`, `aria-expanded`, etc.
- Improving keyboard navigation and screen reader interpretation

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes

By working through this project, I aimed to:

- Master the use of **semantic HTML elements**
- Understand how to **structure content for accessibility**
- Implement **ARIA roles and attributes** effectively
- Improve **SEO** and **user experience** through proper markup

These attributes improve how assistive technologies interpret and interact with your UI, helping create inclusive web experiences for all users.
